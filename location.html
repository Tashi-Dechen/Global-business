<h1>Basachu</h1>
<p>Hydropower Project is a hydropower plant located on the Basochhu River in Wangdue Phodrang District of Bhutan.</p>
<p>he Basochhu River is a tributary of the Punatsangchhu River. The project is a run-of-the-river type, which means it generates electricity using the natural flow of the river without creating a large storage dam.</p>
<p>The project was developed in two phases. Phase I, with a capacity of 24 megawatts, was commissioned in 2001.</p>
<p>The project is owned and operated by Druk Green Power Corporation.</p>
<p>Basochhu Hydropower Project was developed with financial and technical support from the Government of Austria.</p>
<p>It is one of the earliest hydropower projects in Bhutan that involved European cooperation.</p>
<p>Its design helps minimize environmental impact, which aligns with Bhutan's policy of environmental conservation and sustainable development.</p>
