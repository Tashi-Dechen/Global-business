<h1>Why do Companies go Global</h1>
<p>One main reason is to reach a larger customer base, since selling in multiple countries increases sales opportunities</p>
<p>Another reason is to reduce costs, as labor, raw materials, or production may be cheaper in other countries.</p>
<p>Companies also go global to access resources that may not be available in their home country, such as natural resources, technology, or skilled labor.</p>
<p>Going global helps companies increase profits and strengthen their brand by gaining international recognition.</p>
<p It also allows businesses to spread risk, because operating in different countries reduces dependence on a single market.></p>
<p>Some companies go global to extend the life cycle of their products by introducing them into new international markets after demand slows in their home country</p>
<p Others expand internationally to gain strategic advantages, such as being closer to customers or suppliers, improving delivery speed, and strengthening relationships.></p>
